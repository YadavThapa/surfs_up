# Results

After the rigourous research analysis we have found the below outcomes as 
1. The mean temperature for the month of June was 74.19 F. 
2. The minimum temperature for the month of June was 64.00 F and maximum temperature for the month of June was 85.00 F. 
3. 25th percentile of June temperature was 73.00 F and 75th percentile was 77.00 F with median 75.00 F.

Similarly, 
4. The mean temperature for the month of December was 71.00 F.
5. The minimum temperature for the month of December was 56.00 F and maximum temperature for the month of December was 83.00 F.
6. 25th percentile of June temperature was 69.00 F and 75th percentile was 74.00 F with median 71.00 F.

# Summary

From the above analysis we came to conclusion that month of June is better than December for the surf business because the higher the temperature, more people come to visit the places and it increase the overall business performance.

# Recommendation

The research finding suggests that month of June is better for opening up the surf and ice-cream business because there is always a positive corelation between temperature variables and sales of icecream.

More the sales of icecream, more be the revenue. Hence we recommend  Avy to open up the business in June(summer) than December (winter). It would be more sustainable from the business point of stand.
